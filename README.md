# My First React App

This app was created from following a tutorial on freecodecamp.org. It shows the name, picture, age and email of 3 different contacts on reload.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app was to get used to nvim, tmux and git in the command line. It was also a refresher of useState and useEffect even though I didnt create separate component files.

## How to run this app

Clone the git repo by either using git clone or downloading and extracting the zip file.

Open the project by cding into the directory or opening the project in your favourite IDE.

In the console, type npm install followed by npm start
